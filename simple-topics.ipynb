      "Ok. This is just Starbucks. Here's my feedback. 1. The parking lot can be difficult to enter and exit. It's only accessible on southbound Freeport. 2. You may want to park behind the building if you're traveling eastbound Sutterville, so you can leave via Argail Way. This also affords you the ability to easily access Freeport southbound or heading west on Argail Way to Babich Ave where you can get back on Sutterville. 3. You may want to park on Argail way if you want an easier time since you can more easily parallel park.\n",
